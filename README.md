# svelte-mapbox-ts (SMAT)

SMAT is a really minimal svelte implementation of (mapbox-gl)[https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js], written in Typescript. Based on https://gitlab.com/jailbreak/svelte-mapbox-gl/-/tree/master.

## Usage

## Development

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `yarn`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Just run:

```bash
yarn package
```

This will build the contents of the `src/lib` folder.
